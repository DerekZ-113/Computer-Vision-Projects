### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
    - You need Python 3.x and OpenCV.
    - Install OpenCV via pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install opencv-python
        ```
        
2. **Running the Application:**
    - Run the script with:
        
        ```bash
        python WebCam2.py
        ```
        

### Usage Guide

- The application captures video from your webcam and allows you to apply different warping effects in real time.
- **Controls:**
    - Press `t` to apply translation.
    - Press `r` to apply rotation.
    - Press `s` to apply scaling.
    - Press `p` to apply perspective transformation.
    - Press `q` to quit the application.

### Project Description

This group project implements a video capture application using OpenCV. It allows real-time image warping effects such as **translation**, **rotation**, **scaling**, and **perspective transformation**. The user can switch between effects using keyboard controls, and the frame rate is calculated to ensure smooth performance.
